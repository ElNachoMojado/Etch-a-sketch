# Etch-a-sketch
This is browser version of a sketchpad. With it, one should be able to use their mouse to create any design they might desire. 
<h2>Before Starting project</h2>
It is expected to make a fair use of google to acquire certain tools that might be useful in the making of a sketchpad. At the moment, I don't have much idea of everything that will be needed to develop a working code for this. Although I have certain ideas for the making of the grid and adjusting its size when the user so desires. In the beginning, I'll keep it simple by dividing the work and focusing only on the grid and the color changing of each square. Then I'll move into other areas such as color selection, eraser feature, etc.
<h2>Learnings from the project</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation and use of event listeners</li>
    <li>Although basic, add more interactivity to a website through javascript</li>
    <li>Better understanding of flex boxes to allow a desired behaviour and layout</li>
  </ul>
